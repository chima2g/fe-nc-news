how to toggle state variables in browser
Why did we have to `${article.article_id}` but on other lines it was OK to {article.article_id}

//TODO: Do we need to set state or just navigate... think we just navigate and once anything needs to know if you're logged, it'll take the value from localStorage

Users folder doesn't fit the naming convention
